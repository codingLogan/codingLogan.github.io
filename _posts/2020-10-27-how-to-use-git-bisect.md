In this post I will show you how to use _git bisect_ to help you find an erroneous test breaking commit. If you've ever spent time _hunting down what commit broke a feature_, or started a chain of test failures I hope this will be of use to you!

## Git Bisect Cheat Sheet
### The commands used in this post

Start the bisect process
```
$ git bisect start
```

Mark currently checked out commit as bad
```
$ git bisect bad
```

Mark a specific tag or commit as good
```
$ git bisect good [tag or commit]
```

Continue marking the commits it checks out for you as good or bad until the process is complete
```
git bisect good
git bisect bad
```

## The Example Commits
I'm using my repository for this blog as my example so I have real hashes to use, even though there are no real problems.

Now, if there was an issue, and I had to go through and test every single one of these to find the culprit, it would be a painful experience...  Lets see if _git bisect_ can help prevent us from so much effort!  I'd rather not test 17 different commits 1 by 1 from the top if I don't have to.

## The git-bisect Process
1. Start the process using _git bisect start_
1. Specify a known bad commit. I'm going to say that my currently checked out commit is _bad_ using _git bisect bad_
1. Specify a known good commit.  From my list above I'm going to say that the good commit was some time ago using _git bisect good 211cd00af648d1e805cc22135de3b1db79640645_

Now the process is running.  In the terminal I get this output, telling me what git bisect is doing for me.  Note, it actually checks out the commit so you can test it out to determine if it's good or bad.
```
Bisecting: 11 revisions left to test after this (roughly 4 steps)
[e0aec5ded852ce9a09f40e0a60f7beb6cffe81d0] Add current navigation style
```

Now looking at our list of commits above, we see it chose a commit right in the middle, which in the Results section below I labeled _(bisect 1)_.  This is still a bad commit, so I'm going to say _git bisect bad_, and the terminal shows me this.
```
Bisecting: 5 revisions left to test after this (roughly 3 steps)
[261a23286ab2d275f8f12a724e32caa244c26478] Merge pull request #5 from codingLogan/jekyll-tags-post
```

It now checked out another new commit for me to test... I will continue labelling and marking the commits as good or bad with _git bisect good_ or _git bisect bad_ and save you the reading of all the output ;).

Once the process has been followed all the way through, _git bisect_ printed this out for me :D
```
c9a55226909479bf3fd70f4c75053c447e6241f6 is the first bad commit
```

That's the one I picked to be the trouble-maker for my example!  So, it does indeed find it, if your tools and checking are effective enough with each commit.

## Conclusion

In this example, I had already determined the good/bad so it was very fast.  In the real environment, you'd want some quality tests and QA with each commit to find if it was indeed good/bad.

_git bisect_ is a useful feature of git that splits the number of potential commits to check in half each time.

The reason I posted about this was because I did this process manually without knowing about the feature git provided...  When I happened to read about it, I was shocked git actually had a feature to help find problem commits!  Next time I'll use the tool, because it's cool.
