          Currently I focus on building <em>front-end web experiences</em> for
          end-users and I've also built back-office software and database
          integrations. If you're reading this, you may be wondering how I might
          fit in with your interests and technology needs, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          To make that answer easier for you, here's a visual heatmap of the
          most relevant technologies and interests of my day to day work.

            <h3>Foster Good Company</h3>
            <p>
              Simply put, I look for ways to turn every moment into a learning
              opportunity and make it enjoyable! Here are some other ways to
              describe what I mean...
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Be good and do good while you are able.</li>
              <li>Find the laughter.</li>
              <li>Expect respect and give it back.</li>
              <li>Build others with encouragement.</li>
              <li>Lift burdenous tasks together.</li>
              <li>Be genuine and mindfully corrective.</li>
              <li>Don't place blame, solve the problem.</li>

            <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
            <p>
              I strive to stay current, learn new skills, and elevate my
              effectiveness. I find great value in stepping away from the screen
              and diving into a technology book or attending a conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              They introduce me to new people, ideas, age-old solutions, and a
              fresh view on how I can solve a problem. Some of my favorite books
              are The Pragmatic Programmer, Eloquent JavaScript, and Code
              Complete.

            <h3>Trust is Key</h3>
            <p>
              I firmly beleive that trust is a key component to successful
              professional relationships and cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
              When employers trust their employees to get the job done, and
              employees genuinely feel trusted and properly empowered, happiness
              and productivity can find its peak.

            <h3>FamilySearch's Getting Started</h3>
            <p>
              While employed at FamilySearch, I had the privilege of turning a
              beautiful UX design into the page you can currently see at.
              <a
                href="https://www.familysearch.org/gettingstarted/"
                target="_blank"

              >
            </p>
            <p>
              It was carefully designed to be responsive to screen-sizes,
              translated to multiple languages, and simple for users to consume.
              These pages were built using highly reusable React components.

            <h3>Diablo Tools</h3>
            <p>
              On a more personal note, I'm a long-time fan of the Diablo series
              of games made by Blizzard Entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
              So much of a fan... I created a small website/tool that helps
              players discover what runes should be placed into socketed items
              to create powerful runeword-enhanced weapons and armor.

              This is a browser game that I created many years ago. Games are
              what brought me into this amazing programming career, so it is
              fitting that I have at least one simple game of my own on display!

          <h2>Why Programming?</h2>

              my interest in stone.</em

        <p>
          My first experience playing a PC game was on a Windows 95 PC around
          the age of 6 (where I hilariously thought the large white CRT monitor
          was a new TV on Christmas morning). Those very early experiences of
          controlling pixels on the screen with a ball-mouse planted a seed of
          curiosity in tech.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the 5th grade that seed sprouted from curiosity to real interest
          when I was assigned to write a career research paper. Somehow, even
          being that young, I chose to research "Computer Network Engineers".
          After turning in the paper I was entranced that a person could make a
          decent living working with computers, and I NEVER looked back!
        </p>

        <p>
          Through my teen years I found myself solving network issues and
          frequently setting up local-area networks for friends and family to
          play games like Diablo II and Starcraft. Combine that with Starcraft's
          Map Editor which gave me a taste of "if-then" constructs to change the
          gameplay, I felt like a techno-wizard!
        </p>

        <p>
          This led me to branch out and make some basic space shooter games
          using Game Maker, which only further deepened my interest in exploring
          software programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          After being the "computer guy" of the family for many years I started
          college, and then I landed my first official programming job building
          back-office websites for a famous pizza company. I worked full-time
          and tackled a full-time load of courses each semester, and graduated
          with a Computer Science degree at UVU in 2016.
