            <p>This was a great solo experience where I communicated directly with a client and a 3rd party vendor.  The client was one of my previous employers, so he knew he could trust my work.</p>
            <p>I was required to design and implement a solution to migrate a sensitive MySQL Database, in batches, to a 3rd party service.</p>
            <p>My client was very satisfied with solution and the experience I provided. I look forward to working with him again.</p>
            <p>Although the code is private for this project, feel free to ask me about it, I'd love to chat!</p>

            <p>This is a browser game that I created many years ago. Games are what brought me into this amazing programming career, so it is fitting that I have at least one simple game of my own on display!</p>
            <p>A playable version of it is hosted on GitHub at
                <a href="https://codingLogan.github.io/dungeon-keys/DungeonKeys/grid.html" target="_blank">this link</a>.
                Feel free to check it out! (Also, you can win, it isn't rigged ;) )
