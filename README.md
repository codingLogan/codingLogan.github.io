# codingLogan.github.io
This site's main goal is to share content with the development community, and to showcase the highlights I've had the privilege of being involved with.

## Contributions welcome
If you would like to contribute by proof-reading, submitting typos, or in any other way improve the site, I'd love to have your feedback.

## Setup... None
I have been developing this site within GitHub using the GitHub Pages.  There's no special setup at this point
